# Social Media Mining 
This project is implemented within the context of the course of Web Mining. Our team consists of Paschalis Frangidis, Papadopoulos Stefanos and Tatiana
Passali.
In our work, we focus on the topic of Climate Change in both Twitter and Instagram platforms, providing an extensive and thorough analysis in many different levels including,
Sentiment Analysis, User Profiling and Like Prediction, among others. For this purpose, we collected a large corpus of a 
considerable amount of tweets and Instagram posts. Additionally, we provide a visualization of our findings as well as an
implementation of a web application in order to ease the user to explore the results derived from our employed methods.
