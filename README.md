# Social Media Mining 
This project is implemented within the context of the course "Web Mining" of MSc Web and Data Science, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. <br />
Our team consists of Paschalis Frangidis, Papadopoulos Stefanos and Tatiana Passali. <br />
In our work, we focus on the topic of Climate Change and for this purpose, we collected a large corpus of tweets and Instagram posts.
We provide an extensive analysis in many different levels including:
<ul>
<li>Sentiment and Emotion Analysis</li>
<li>User Profiling</li>
<li>User Interests Extraction</li>
<li>Like Prediction</li>
</ul>
<br />
Additionally, we provide a visualization of our findings as well as an implementation of a web application in order to ease the user to explore the results derived from our employed methods.
